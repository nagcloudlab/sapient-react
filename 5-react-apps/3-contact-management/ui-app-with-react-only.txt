design issues with react/react-native only 
-------------------------------------------

==> state , state-change & n/wing logic , all are in UI-component
==> if same state required on mltiple components,
    pass down the tree as props or use put in 'context'


causes

  => components are heavy-weight, i.e not re-usable
  => unit-testing not possible if have too much n/w logic on components


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

solution:

    ==> flux pattern
