steps working with redux
-------------------------------

 step-1 : know your UI-application's state

            e.g contact management
            - contacts

 step-2 : identify force/action(s) which cause state change

        - ADD_CONTACT
        - EDIT_CONTACT
        - DELETE_CONTACT

 step-3 : define reducer/pure-function to make new-state for an action

          - contactsReducer(state,action) => new-state

 step-4 : combine multiple reducer(s) to root-reducer
 step-5 : create single-store with root-reducer
